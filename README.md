# Welcome to Void.
## Vape UI Library
I have edited the Vape UI Library created by [dawid](https://v3rmillion.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1052423)/[post](https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=1098651). The changes that I have made are deleting the old library upon another inject for the people that do that, and have also changed the name of the actual UI in the workspace from "ui" to a jumble of letters to allow for less likelyhood of being caught as a script and to also prevent any chance of getting overrided by possible game UIs.

## Void
Void is a script that I have been working on since I got into Roblox scripting. It is powerful, and has a load of features. There will be a list of supported games and all the features along with changelogs in this readme file in the future.
