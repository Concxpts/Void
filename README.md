# Welcome to Void.
## Vape UI Library
I have edited the Vape UI Library created by [dawid](https://v3rmillion.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1052423)/[post](https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=1098651). I have made a few quality of life changes and optimizations to make the UI library work for Void in the best way possible. I will be adding on to it in the future to implement things like remote spies, lua code editors, etc.

## Community
I would love for Void to become one of the largest scripts on Roblox, allowing you to play your favorite games how you want. I would love for volunteers to help it and make it a community project, discovering new cheats and exploits like kicking players or crashing them, game cheats, etc.

## The future of Void
Void may become even bigger than just a script. I may make it an exploit, with very powerful tools and APIs, with the Void script being an internal feature.
