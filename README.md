# Welcome to Void.
## Vape UI Library
I have edited the Vape UI Library created by [dawid](https://v3rmillion.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1052423)/[post](https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=1098651). The changes that I have made are deleting the old library upon another inject for the people that do that, and have also changed the name of the actual UI in the workspace from "ui" to a jumble of letters to allow for less likelyhood of being caught as a script and to also prevent any chance of getting overrided by possible game UIs.

## Void
Void is a script that I have been working on since I got into Roblox scripting. It is powerful, and has a load of features. There will be a list of supported games and all the features along with changelogs in this readme file in the future.

## Loadstring
`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Concepts0/Void/experimental/void.lua"))()` 
-- Experimental branch (possibly buggy, unstable, but could have more features)

`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Concepts0/Void/main/void.lua"))()`
-- Master branch (stable, but could have less features

## Community Features
If Void gets big and you're interested in adding features and possibly even making them apart of the official release, feel free to fork the files and create pull requests. It would be great to have a community project to create one of the greatest scripts.
